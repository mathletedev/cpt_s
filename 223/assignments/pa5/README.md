# Programming Assignment 4 & 5

> Amazon Inventory Query System

## Instructions

```bash
# download dataset
make data 

# compiles the project
make build

# runs the application
make exec
```

Note: `make data` pulls the CSV file from my personal Dropbox. Alternatively, download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/datasets/promptcloud/amazon-product-dataset-2020) and move to `data/dataset.csv`.

## PA5 Notes

Initially, I implemented `msort()` (merge sort) using immutable linked lists, but copying the list was expensive, resulting in a merge sort time complexity of $O(n^2)$. This meant `msort()` performed similarly (or even worse) than `isort()` (insertion sort).

Therefore, I implemented `msort()` using a mutable linked list, and being able to directly mutate pointers allowed for $O(n \log n)$ time complexity. This became immediately apparent in the results below:
- `isort()` slightly outperforms `msort()` for small lists (e.g. `> listInventory Toys`)
    - However, the difference is on the scale of microseconds, and is thus negligible
- `msort()` drastically outperforms `isort()` for large lists (e.g. `> listInventory "Toys & Games"`)
    - `msort()` takes around 0.02s on average, whereas `isort()` takes around 1.9s on average.

This shows how much better merge sort's `O(n \log n)` time complexity is necessary for large datasets, compared to insertion sort's `O(n^2)` time complexity.

## PA4 Notes

- `LinkedList` and `AvlMap` are copied from my PA1 and PA3, respectively. Some modifications were made.
- `AvlMap` was used to map command names to functions.
- I use a hash table / hash map to store `id` and `category` relations. This allows for $O(1)$ amortised insertions and lookups.
    - My implementation uses quadratic probing and rehashing to resolve hash collisions.
    - I use `std::hash` to hash `id` and `category` strings.
